# Highway Connection Lane

This repository contains a Python-based simulation for modeling and analyzing highway traffic for one connection lane connecting to a highway.
It includes features to simulate vehicle movement, calculate metrics such as exit times, and visualize results through animations and statistical plots.

Before you run the simulation, please install requirements first.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- **Traffic Simulation**: Models vehicles on a highway and a connection lane, including interactions such as overtaking and merging.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates metrics like maximum and mean exit times for various traffic conditions.
- **Visualization**: Generates animated visualizations of vehicle movement and boxplots for key metrics.
- **Customizability**: Parameters such as the number of vehicles, highway length, and desired speed are fully customizable.

## Project Information
This project was created as SSI assignment at FJFI CVUT (2024/25).
